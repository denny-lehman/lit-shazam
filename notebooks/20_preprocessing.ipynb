And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of  Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of  Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream  must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He  did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that  vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic  rolled on under the night.    Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by  year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no  matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further … And  one fine morning—    So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into  the past.
